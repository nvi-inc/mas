= Installing MAS on CentOS
Dave Horsley <david.e.horsley@nasa.gov>
v0.3

:sectnums:


== MGO MAS

Hardware setup:

- 3x 4TB HDDs in RAID5 configuration (hardware or software, doesn't matter)
- 1x 256GB  SSD for DB cache and swap
- 32GB RAM

== Setup RAID

Machine has a hardware RAID controller which can be used.

Otherwise, software RAID can be configured during install.

== Install OS

Follow standard setup, install OS to RAID.

Partition the SSD with 32GB for swap, remainder partitioned but setup as cache post install 

Database will be stored in `/var/lib/influxdb` so should be on its on LV with most of the space of the  raid

=== Setting up LVM cache

Post install, do the following 

(replace `<vg>` with volume group, likely something like "centos_severname", and  `<ssd>` with SSD cache partition make in
install, and DB LV with `<vg>/<data>`. Check `lsblk`.)

  vgextend <vg> /dev/<ssd>
  lvcreate --type cache --cachemode writethrough -L <size>G -n cache <vg>/<data> /dev/<ssd>

Size should be the size of the cache partition, *less about 20 MB for metadata*.

TIP: If SSD ever fails, you will need to remove with
+
    lvconvert --uncached <vg>/<data>
    vgreduce --removedmissing --force <vg>


== InfluxDB

InfluxDB is the timeseries database 

=== Add the InfluxDB repository

Create `/etc/yum.repos.d/influxdb.repo` with contents

    [influxdb]
    name = InfluxDB Repository - RHEL $releasever
    baseurl = https://repos.influxdata.com/rhel/$releasever/$basearch/stable
    enabled = 1
    gpgcheck = 1
    gpgkey = https://repos.influxdata.com/influxdb.key
    EOF


=== Install

Install 

    yum install influxdb


Enable at startup and run

    systemctl enable influxdb
    systemctl start influxdb


=== Create `ops` database

To interact with InfluxDB, use the `influx` CLI. 

Enter:

	create database ops


=== Setup Authorization/Authentication

Next, setup up accounts with the minimum required privileges.


. Create an admin user. Run the `influx` CLI and enter:


    create user admin with password '<password>' with all privileges


. Create accounts for Grafana and Telegraf instances

    create user "grafana" with password '<pwd>'
    create user "telegraf" with password '<pwd>'

. Setup permissions for non-admin accounts

    grant read on "ops" to "grafana"
    grant write on "ops" to "telegraf"

. Enable enforcing by editing `/etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf` to set `auth-enabled` option to `true` in the `[http]` section.
Eg:

    [http]
      enabled = true
      bind-address = ":8086"
      auth-enabled = true # âœ¨
      log-enabled = true
      write-tracing = false
      pprof-enabled = false
      https-enabled = true
      https-certificate = "/etc/ssl/influxdb.pem"


Restart InfluxDB server with

    systemctl restart influxdb

=== Enable firewall access

Enable access to InfluxDB from the network

    firewall-cmd --add-port=8086/tcp --permanent
    firewall-cmd --reload

NOTE: You may wish to specify a subnet here.


== Grafana and Configure

=== Add the Grafana repository

Create `/etc/yum.repos.d/grafana.repo` with contents

    [grafana]
    name=grafana
    baseurl=https://packages.grafana.com/oss/rpm
    repo_gpgcheck=1
    enabled=1
    gpgcheck=1
    gpgkey=https://packages.grafana.com/gpg.key
    sslverify=1
    sslcacert=/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt

=== Install

Install

    yum install grafana

Set to run on boot

    systemctl daemon-reload
    systemctl start grafana-server 
    systemctl enable grafana-server

=== Install extra dependencies

Setup server-side image rendering:

    yum install fontconfig
    yum install freetype*
    yum install urw-fonts

This allows alert emails to have rendered graphics

=== Allow binding low ports

IMPORTANT: Only do this if Grafana is the only HTTP(S) service you run on this machine,
otherwise use a web server as a reverse proxy.

Give the Grafana binary permissions to bind to ports less than 1024

	setcap 'cap_net_bind_service=+ep' /usr/sbin/grafana-server

Then edit `/etc/grafana/grafana.ini`:

.  Set variable `http-port` and set to `80` (or `433` if you are using HTTPS, see next section) 
.  Set `root_url` to  `http://<mas_address>/`  (or `https://...`)

Restart the server with

    systemctl restart grafana-server

=== Setup HTTPS (optional)

In `[server]` section of `/etc/grafana/grafana.ini`

. Set `http-port = 433`
. Set `protocol = https`
. Set the `cert_file` and `cert_key` to the relevant path of your TLS cert and key.
. Set `root_url` to  `https://<mas_address>/`


=== Setup firewall

    firewall-cmd --add-service=http --permanent
    firewall-cmd --reload

NOTE: you may want to specify a subnet here

=== Login and reset admin password

From a browser: connect to `http://mashost` (perhaps localhost if you are running a GUI on your MAS)

Enter username/password `admin`/`admin`. You will then be prompted to change
this to something appropriate.

=== Add InfluxDB as a data source

1. Open the side menu by clicking the Grafana icon in the top header.
2. In the side menu under the `Dashboards` link you should find a link named `Data Sources`.
3. Click the `+ Add data source` button in the top header.
4. Select *InfluxDB* from the *Type* dropdown.

Enter the following fields

|===
|Field       | Content

|Name        | `influxdb`
|Default     | yes
|Url         | `http://127.0.0.1:8086`
|Access      | `Server` (default)
|Database    | `ops`
|User        | `grafana`
|Password    | Password entered earlier
|===

=== Add users

Grafana supports complex user configuration, however since we only need this to be accessible from the local site, it is likely simplest to have a single "operator" user.


NOTE: This may might not be accurate as new versions of Grafana have added the ability to directly add a user.

By default Grafana will assume an account to be linked to an email address. We can bypass this however:

. Go to menu:Configuration[Users] then press "Invite".

. Enter "operator" in the "Email or Username" field and unselect "Send invite email".

. You will be taken back to the users page. Select the "Pending Invites (1)" tab.

. In the "operator" row, select "Copy Invite". 

. Paste the URL into the address bar 

. Give the operator a suitable password and set the email address to something dummy (eg "operator@localhost")

== Install Telegraf-VLBI

This is a fork of the open source project Telegraf, which includes some additional
VLBI specific utilities.

Since VLBI domain is no longer available, this package must be provided
directly.


Install with:

    yum install telegraf_vlbi_0.3.x.rpm

Enable at startup and run with:

    systemctl enable telegraf
    systemctl start telegraf

=== Install optional dependencies

To run 

    yum install lm_sensors

=== Configure Telegraf

Edit `/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf`

. Setup influxdb output:  `[[outputs.influxdb]]`:
    . Set urls (may not be nessessary of MAS machine)
    . Set username and password if authentication is enabled

. Set antenna IP in `[[inputs.modbus_antenna]]`

. Set data logger IP in `[[inputs.delphin_datalogger]]`


=== Setup firewall to allow RDBE-multicast

*UNTESTED*

    firewall-cmd --permanent --direct --add-rule ipv4 filter INPUT 0 -m udp -p udp -m pkttype --pkt-type multicast -j ACCEPT


== Appendix


This may or may not be needed  debending

=== Install Apache

Grafana runs it's own production grade web server, however if you wish to expose
Grafana and with other web apps, you will need to setup a reverse proxy using
Apache or nginx. Here we document Apache

Install with

    yum install httpd

and start with

    systemctl start httpd


==== Setup Reverse Proxy

Edit the Apache httpd configuration to include

    <VirtualHost *:80>
      ServerName server.domain.com
      RewriteEngine on
      RewriteRule ^/?$ /grafana/ [R=permanent,L]
      <Location "/grafana">
        ProxyPass http://localhost:3000
      </Location>
      ProxyPassReverse /grafana http://localhost:3000
    </VirtualHost>

Ensure Grafana has the correct root URL by editing `/etc/grafana/grafana.ini` to
contain 

    [server]
    ...
    root_url = http://server.domain.com/
    ...
